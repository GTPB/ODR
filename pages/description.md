Research data management and the reproducibility - or provenance - of scientific findings are both gaining importance. However, meeting the
practical requirements of either of these is difficult for individual researchers. Aspirational acronyms such as FAIR are good and well, but what
actually needs to be done throughout the data cycle, from collection, to analysis, sharing, publication and archiving is a moving target. In this
workshop we will explore current good practices by studying examples from the recent literature. We will touch on the following topics:
- Collecting, annotating and revising data
- Automating data analysis
- Making the analytical environment reusable
- Publishing results
- Archiving everything
The workshop will last three days, during which we will practice the various steps hands-on.
