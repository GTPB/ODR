Research data management and the reproducibility - or provenance - of scientific findings are both gaining importance. However, meeting the
practical requirements of either of these is difficult for individual researchers. Aspirational acronyms such as FAIR are good and well, but what
actually needs to be done throughout the data cycle, from collection, to analysis, sharing, publication and archiving is a moving target. In this
course, we will explore current good practices by studying examples from the recent literature. We will touch on the following topics:

- Collecting, annotating and revising data
- Automating data analysis
- Making the analytical environment reusable
- Publishing results
- Archiving everything

The course will last three days, during which we will practice the various steps hands-on.

Aspirational acronyms...  How about this?
Seeking to comply with FAIR rules, investing in well built Data Management Plans, leaves the practitioner in need for more guidance in the day-to-day choices that need to be made to walk the path to reproducibility in the data life cycle, considering publication goals while leaving room for sharing and IP protection obn the data itseld.  In this course, we will ...
